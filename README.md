Types of Wireframes
Differences Between Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Definition: Simple, rough sketches or digital layouts that outline the basic structure and content placement of a design.

Characteristics:

Black-and-white or grayscale

Placeholder text (“Lorem ipsum” or simple lines)

Boxes and shapes instead of images

Focused on layout and flow rather than style

When Used:

Early stages of design process

Brainstorming ideas

Quickly testing different layouts

Gathering initial feedback from stakeholders

High-Fidelity Wireframes

Definition: Detailed, polished versions of wireframes that closely resemble the final product.

Characteristics:

Includes real or near-final content

Styled typography, colors, branding, and images

Interactive elements (clickable prototypes)

Higher visual accuracy and alignment with final design

When Used:

Later stages of design process

Usability testing

Presenting to clients or stakeholders for approval

Preparing for handoff to developers

Identifying the Wireframe Type

Based on the description and context:

If the wireframe is simple, uses boxes, placeholders, and minimal details, it is a Low-Fidelity Wireframe.

If the wireframe is detailed, includes real content, branding, colors, and interactivity, it is a High-Fidelity Wireframe.
